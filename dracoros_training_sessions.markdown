### Beginners’ Strand

(no previous skills required)

#### 14:00–15:30 · From Dramatic Text to DraCor TEI: XML/TEI Introduction, Encoding Drama in TEI, and Automation of Encoding  
In the first part of this session, we will introduce XML/TEI and discuss why the TEI format is used in Computational Literary Studies. In the second part, we will present different workflows to encode dramatic texts in TEI. We will consider three types of text sources: texts without any markup, texts with basic markup, and texts with advanced markup. We will also discuss how to automate the encoding process and which tools may be used for support. Finally, we will provide a flowchart to help you choose a suitable encoding workflow for your project.   

#### 15:30–16:00 · Coffee Break

#### 16:00–17:30 · Simple Analyses with DraCor Data

We will explore browser-based applications for visualising and analysing plays from the DraCor platform. The focus will be on tools such as [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/), [RAWGraphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/), [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), and [Gephi Lite](https://gephi.org/gephi-lite/), with a brief outlook on additional resources. Participants are welcome to bring their own use cases, drawing from the more than 4,000 plays available on DraCor. (Slides for the workshop are [here](https://lehkost.github.io/slides/2025-09-01-dracor-simple/index.html).)
