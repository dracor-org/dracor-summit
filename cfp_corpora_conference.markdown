## DraCor Corpora Conference

The **DraCor Corpora Conference** is part of the DraCor Summit 2025. It will take place on **Tuesday, 2 September 2025**.

As of now, the DraCor platform hosts **28 corpora in 22 languages**, comprising more than 4,000 plays encoded in TEI/XML, ranging from Greek antiquity to the second half of the 20th century (sorted by number of plays):

* FreDraCor, GerDraCor, EngDraCor, RusDraCor, CalDraCor, DutchDraCor, ItaDraCor, HunDraCor, SweDraCor, UDraCor, GreekDraCor, AmDraCor, GerShDraCor, ShakeDraCor, RomDraCor, PolDraCor, AlsDraCor, SpanDraCor, YiDraCor, TatDraCor, BashDraCor, including some in the making: ArDraCor, CzeDraCor, GeorgDraCor, HeDraCor, JesDraCor, NeoLatDraCor, RoDraCor

The DraCor Corpus Conference is intended as an opportunity for corpus maintainers to present their corpora in dedicated **10-minute presentations**. This insight into various corpora is especially intended to discuss structural problems, facilitate corpus alignments, foster the exchange of workflows and present innovative approaches to corpus building. Anyone working on corpus projects is invited to apply, including colleagues whose corpora are not yet part of the DraCor environment.

When applying, please provide:

* Name of corpus
* Corpus coverage (temporally, spatially)
* Information on corpus maintainers and participating institutions
* URL and/or repository of the corpus, if available
* Encoding format (if not already TEI/XML)
* 300–500 words on the status of the respective corpus project and the expected benefits of a conference contribution

Information on where to submit your application will follow shortly.

The round of corpus presentations will be followed by cross-corpora discussions about general workflows, alignment and other strategies to build and maintain a corpus in the DraCor ecosystem.

Please send your abstract in PDF format to [info@dracor.org](mailto:info@dracor.org) by **6 May 2025**, quoting in the object “submission corpora conference”.
