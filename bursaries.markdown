All participants are welcome to apply for travel bursaries via the [registration form](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/digital-humanities/events/dracor-summit). Please note that priority will be given to to applicants who actively contribute to the Summit â€“ whether as part of the DraCor Corpora Conference, the Workshop on Computational Drama Analysis, or through a pitch for the DraCor Barcamp. While general registration remains open until 15 July 2025, we kindly ask bursary applicants to submit their applications by 30 June 2025.
