### Clarisse Bardiot: <br />The Show Programme, the LLM and the Ontology: Designing Workflows for Performing Arts Analytics

Theatre programmes are a vital resource for reconstructing the conditions of a performing arts production. Found across numerous heritage collections, they provide direct data on performers, technicians, and venues while revealing artistic networks, editorial strategies, and institutional dynamics. Although digitisation has enhanced access to these often-overlooked materials, significant methodological challenges persist: inconsistent database transcriptions, heterogeneous data models with limited interoperability, and no reliable link to the original source.

Drawing on the ERC project [From Stage to Data](https://doi.org/10.3030/101097091), which examines programmes from the Festival d’Avignon (1947–present), this keynote addresses key methodological challenges in performing arts analytics. The presentation outlines a computational workflow that combines Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with an extension of the Linked Art ontology for performing arts. The extracted data are connected to their source via the Arvest platform, ensuring full traceability. Examples from the Avignon corpus demonstrate how this approach enables analyses of artistic circulation and collaboration over time. The presentation also calls for the creation of a comprehensive corpus of theatre programmes, which would unlock numerous research avenues in performing arts history. Such a corpus would provide the research community with standardised, interoperable data, supporting comparative studies across institutions, time periods, and geographical contexts.
